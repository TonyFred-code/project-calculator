  - on the expression screen, only zero should be displayed or a blank screen with a cursor
  - the result screen should be blank.


1 Buttons and their reactions
      1.1 a digit (0 - 9)
        - the value of the digit should be stored in a variable as the first operand
        - the expression should be updated with the value of the digit (and the earlier zero removed).
      1.2 an operational symbol (+, -, / or *)
      	- as there's no first operand, it should be discarded
      	- if the operational symbol is minus and there is no first operand
      	  - it should cause negation of the first operand's value
      	  - clicking another operator (not "-") after negation of first operand should reverse the negation.
      1.3 the decimal digit (.)
        - the zero "0" on screen should change to "0."
      1.4 the all-clear button
        - it should just reset as it ought to (similar to being discarded but save code if the check for calculator's state never happens
      1.5 the equals sign (=)
        - zero or nothing should be displayed (given absence of a first operand)



initiating a first operand and calculating a result
  - clicking a digit (on page load);
    -- then clicking an operator... (+, -, / or *)
      -- the operator should be saved
      -- the calculator should get set for input of second operand;
  after a saved operator and a saved first operand...
   -- clicking a digit should commence input of the second operand.
    -- after presence of full or part of second operand
     -- clicking the equal to sign should operate and display the value needed.
