0 Upon loading
  - on the expression screen, only zero should be displayed or a blank screen with a cursor
  - the result screen should be blank.


1 Buttons and their reactions
      1.1 a digit (0 - 9)
        - the value of the digit should be stored in a variable as the first operand
        - the expression should be updated with the value of the digit (and the earlier zero removed).
      1.2 an operational symbol (+, -, / or *)
      	- as there's no first operand, it should be discarded
      	- if the operational symbol is minus and there is no first operand
      	  - it should cause negation of the first operand's value
      	  - clicking another operator (not "-") after negation of first operand should reverse the negation.
      1.3 the decimal digit (.)
        - the zero "0" on screen should change to "0."
      1.4 the all-clear button
        - it should just reset as it ought to (similar to being discarded but save code if the check for calculator's state never happens
      1.5 the backspace button
        - same with the all-clear button in this context
      1.6 the equals sign (=)
        - zero or nothing should be displayed (given absence of a first operand)

-----
2 If the user clicks a digit upon loading, ( - initiating a first operand)
    2.1 and then clicks another digit,
       - update variable containing first operand to be a combination of the first clicked digit followed by newly clicked digit
      --- clicks a digit (1) - (expression should show "1");
      --- clicks another digit (2) - (expression should now show "12");
       - value of the combination should be the new first operand.
       - continue such process...limit digit length to about 11 or 12... (9,999,999,999,999)*
       - update the expression displayed to the user using the value of the first operand.
    2.2 and then clicks an operator,
      - save first operand's value
      - save clicked operator in a variable
      - get set for input of second operand
      --- clicks 1 - (expression "1")
      --- clicks minus (-) - expression ("1 -"**  or "1-");
      - update expression displayed to user to be a combination of first operand and operator.
       2.2.1 clicks operator again
         - replace stored operator with new operator
         - update expression appropriately
        --- clicks 1 (expression "1");
        --- clicks plus ("+") - (expression "1 +");
        --- clicks minus ("-") - (expression "1 -");
       2.2.2 after presence of an operator and a first operand but no second operand
         - clicks the
    2.3 the decimal digit
       - append decimal point if one isn't present already
    2.4 all-clear button
       - should reset calculator's state to default
    2.5 backspace button
       - should remove last clicked character from expression
       - and update necessary variables
       --- clicks 1 - expression ("1");
           then --- clicks dot (.) - expression ("1.");
            --- clicks backspace btn - expression ("1");
           or --- clicks plus ("+") - expression ("1+");
           --- clicks backspace btn - expression ("1");
    2.6 equals sign
        - display value of first operand in expression
